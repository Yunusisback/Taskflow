# TaskFlow: Modern Kanban Panosu


This is my first project built entirely on Drag-and-Drop architecture. It goes beyond traditional data entry applications and was created to deeply understand and implement the interaction patterns that power modern Single Page Applications (SPA). Built on top of my React and JavaScript foundations, it is a Trello-like interactive Kanban Board developed to practice complex state management and algorithmic data manipulation.


A high-performance, fully interactive Kanban Board built with **React 19** and **@dnd-kit**.


**The project is under development.**
